## Instructions for deploying a local environment
Prerequisites:
* Python 3
* Pip

Make sure you update [python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [update pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/). Then, `cd` into the root folder of this repo and install these modules:
```
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-minify-plugin mkdocs-redirects mkdocs-video mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin mkdocs-rss-plugin
```
Deploy to local server from that root folder:
```
mkdocs serve
```
And it should give you a weburl in the terminal to go to --> http://127.0.0.1:8000
