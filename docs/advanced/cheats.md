Some of MiSTer's cores have the capability to apply cheats in-game. The cheats are in a specific format and are automatically pulled from [gamehacking.org's](https://gamehacking.org/){target=_blank} website when you run the downloader script. These cheat files and your ROM have to be named correctly, and the ROM has to match a crc32 check in order to work correctly. Additionally, for CD-based games the cheat has to be placed into the same folder as the CD-games' files.



Define more advanced instructions for cheats here as opposed to the very simple explanation in basics/games.md
