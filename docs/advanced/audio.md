The MiSTer has audio filters that you can use to make the audio sound less harsh and balanced to your ears. Some old game systems were not made for raw digital output, they had analog audio filters in place before the sound reached the speakers and your ears. These filters are generated using mathematical formulas to represent real common filters used in electronics. You can find all of the filters in the [Filters_MiSTer Github Repository](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Filters_MiSTer){target=_blank}.
