There are a few different ways you can use a CRT display with the MiSTer. The two main methods are either using the VGA port on the Analog IO board or using a specific Direct Video HDMI to VGA adapter.

## Configuration Table

Here's a table that shows you what options correlate to what video connection, to make it a bit easier to decide what you need in order to connect to your CRT, and what settings are required in the MiSTer.ini to get it to work.

¹ Scan-doubled = 2x resolution (e.g. 240p > 480p)  
² Upscaled resolution = video_mode  
³ External "direct video" (HDMI to VGA) adapter required - native resolution only (no upscaling or scan-doubling  
⁴ External "direct video" adapter requires modification to pass Sync on Green (SoG)  
⁵ External RGB to NTSC/PAL converter required
