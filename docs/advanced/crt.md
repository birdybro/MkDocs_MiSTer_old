There are a few different ways you can use a CRT display with the MiSTer. The two main methods are either using the VGA port on the Analog IO board or using a specific Direct Video HDMI to VGA adapter.

## Configuration Table

Here's a simple table that shows you what options correlate to what video connection, to make it a bit easier to decide what you need in order to connect to your CRT, and what settings are required in the MiSTer.ini to get it to work.

* Scan-doubled = 2x resolution (e.g. 240p > 480p)
** Upscaled resolution = video_mode
*** External "direct video" (HDMI to VGA) adapter required - native resolution only (no upscaling or scan-doubling
**** External "direct video" adapter requires modification to pass Sync on Green (SoG)
***** External RGB to NTSC/PAL converter required
