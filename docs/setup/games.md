To play games on the MiSTer you will need to transfer them to your MicroSD. There are other ways to play games, like over a NAS or using USB drive, but for now we're going to stick to the most basic easy method. If you'd like more information on these other methods you can head to the [Advanced Networking Page](../advanced/network.md) of this documentation site, to find out more.

## Transfer ROMs over the Network with Samba/SMB

The MiSTer comes setup with a Samba server already. This means you can connect to it like any other shared folder on the network. It's pretty easy. If you are using Windows, all you need to do is type `\\MiSTer\sdcard\` in the address bar at the top of File Explorer and press enter. You can do the same in Linux or on MacOS depending on how you access network shares on those systems, the same way.

How to play games.

* Where roms go, directory structure.
* SD, USB and network storage options, and order they are checked.
