# Initial Setup

This guide will help you setup your MiSTer for the first time. We will help you setup your sdcard, then update your MiSTer system, and then show you how to run a game in one of the console cores.

Requirements:

* A MicroSD card (preferably 4GB minimum)
* A keyboard
* Your MiSTer connected to the internet (preferably by Ethernet/RJ45 for this first step)

## 1. Flash Mr. Fusion to MicroSD

Mr. Fusion provides a compact image that you can download and flash onto an SD card of any size with a tool like  [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/){target=_blank}, [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/){target=_blank}, [Apple Pi Baker](https://www.tweaking4all.com/software/macosx-software/applepi-baker-v2/){target=_blank}, or even [dd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_%28Unix%29){target=_blank}.

We're going to use balenaEtcher for this guide. We install balenaEtcher by [downloading the latest release for our computer](https://www.balena.io/etcher/){target=_blank} and installing it. 

Next we're going to [download the latest release of Mr. Fusion](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/mr-fusion/releases){target=_blank}:

Next, we will insert our MicroSD card into our computer and then open balenaEtcher. We will select "Flash from file" and navigate to the Mr Fusion file we downloaded a step earlier.

Then we need to select our MicroSD card as the target to flash.

And click "Flash!"

## 2. Start Mr. Fusion

Next we just need to carefully insert our MicroSD card into the DE10-Nano (**NOT the MicroSD slot on the IO board on top!**).

Now turn on your DE10-Nano. For a stock DE10-Nano this means just plugging in the barrel plug that was supplied with it. **Make sure you do not use an adapter with the wrong voltage!! This could permanently damage your new device!**

We will wait up to a few minutes for the Mr. Fusion installer to complete. Be patient, or else you may have to start over again. When the MiSTer On Screen Display with fuzzy static behind it appears, that means you have successfully installed the MiSTer software/OS onto your MicroSD. 

If you have bought your device from a custom supplier, they may have an external power switch either on a y-adapter or somewhere else. Also if you have the Digital IO board there is a power switch on top and should be a power jumper of some kind between the DE10-Nano and the optional USB hub beneath it. Please ask your supplier for assistance if you are unclear on how to hook up the power to your MiSTer. It's better to be safe than sorry!

## 3. Define your controller(s)
