# Initial Setup

This guide will help you setup your MiSTer for the first time. We will help you setup your sdcard, then update your MiSTer system, and then show you how to run a game in one of the console cores.

## Mr. Fusion

Mr. Fusion provides a compact image that you can download and flash onto an SD card of any size with a tool like  [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/), [Apple Pi Baker](https://www.tweaking4all.com/software/macosx-software/applepi-baker-v2/), or even [dd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_%28Unix%29).

We're going to use balenaEtcher for this guide. We install balenaEtcher by [downloading the latest release for our computer](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) and installing it. 

Next we're going to [download the latest release of Mr. Fusion](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/mr-fusion/releases):

Next I load my MicroSD card into my computer and open balenaEtcher. We will.
