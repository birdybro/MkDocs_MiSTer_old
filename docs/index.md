## What is MiSTer FPGA?

**MiSTer** is an open source project that aims to recreate various classic computers, game consoles and arcade machines, using modern hardware. It allows software and game images to run as they would on original hardware, using peripherals such as mice, keyboards, joysticks and other game controllers.

MiSTer utilizes a readily available **FPGA** board called the '**[DE10-Nano](http://de10-nano.terasic.com){target=_blank}**', which connects to your TV or monitor via **HDMI** video out. It can also be expanded with various **[add-ons](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki/Addons-Overview){target=_blank}** (such as a 7-port USB hub, SDRAM, and either a Digital I/O or Analog I/O board).

The MiSTer software/OS itself is **[freely downloadable](setup/mr-fusion.md)**, and anyone is welcome to contribute to its development. In fact MiSTer relies on the contributions of many developers for the various systems (known as '**cores**') it replicates. 

The MiSTer project is currently under active development, with new cores, features, and bug-fixes appearing on a regular basis.
