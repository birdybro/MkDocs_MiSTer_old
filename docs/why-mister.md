The MiSTer is an excellent option for retro gaming enthusiasts to enjoy their favorite games with low input latency, high quality audio, and excellent video output. Here's a few reasons why MiSTer is probably the right retro gaming solution for you to enjoy the history of classic gaming and computing.

## Wide support for peripherals

MiSTer supports serial-attached accessories like Lightguns to allow you to play games on a CRT with the original instant response. It also supports connecting MIDI devices to the computer cores, similar to the real thing. One of these is MT32-Pi which is a baremetal emulator of a Roland MT-32, and it works with ao486, X68000, and more, just like the real thing. 7 USB ports in the add-on board gives you more than enough flexibility. MiSTer is compatible with multiple low-latency controller adapter solutions such as RaphNet, DaemonBite, and more! USB, Bluetooth, and 2.4ghz controllers work without any complicated setup requirements.

## Uncompromised RGB Video Output

The MiSTer's HDMI video output pushes the hardware on the DE10-Nano to the limit. MiSTer outputs RGB with no chroma subsampling. The scaling, filtering, and shadowmask features exceed that which is possible on most HDMI-modded systems and popular upscalers. The video output can produce near-perfect smooth scrolling on the right modern displays, which is something that often cannot be achieved even with expensive scalers or HDMI mods on original hardware.

## Audiophile-grade listening experience

Some of MiSTer's cores have been tuned by utilizing Artemio Urbina's legendary tool, [MDFourier](https://junkerhq.net/MDFourier/), for accuracy. Other cores have been expertly tuned using high quality recordings for comparisons analyzed at the sample-level. And some cores have had the entire sound chips replicated in digital logic form carefully.

MiSTer's audio outputs at 16-bits 48kHz by default with an option to change for 96kHz to favorably increase the resolution of the aliasing, especially for cores with odd audio output frequencies while maintaining broad compatibility with TVs and audio gear. Since MiSTer is digital to digital for Audio, this can make it a significant upgrade over your console collection in one simple package.

## Developers Developers Developers Developers

The open source aspect of the MiSTer project necessarily entails more developer engagement than any private company making FPGA cores hiring individual developers could hope to achieve. The powerful framework and system files maintained by Alexey Melnikov (also known as Sorgelig) makes it easier for core developers to focus on developing the logic of their core as opposed to focusing too much time on how to support controllers, video output, audio output, and all the other struggles that previous FPGA developers had to deal with.

MiSTer users get to enjoy the benefits of this developer-friendly framework in the form of frequent core updates and a large number of exciting features that are available to all cores.
