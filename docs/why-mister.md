The MiSTer is an excellent option for retro gaming enthusiasts to enjoy their favorite games with low input latency, high quality audio, and excellent video output. Here's a few reasons why MiSTer is right for you.

## Uncompromised RGB Video Output

The MiSTer's HDMI video output pushes the hardware on the DE10-Nano to the limit. MiSTer outputs RGB with no chroma subsampling. The scaling, filtering, and shadowmask features exceed that which is possible on most HDMI-modded systems and popular upscalers. The video output can produce near-perfect smooth scrolling on the right modern displays, which is something that often cannot be achieved even with expensive scalers or HDMI mods on original hardware.

## Audiophile-grade listening experience

Audio output similarly outputs at 16-bits 48kHz by default with an option to change for 96kHz to favorably increase the resolution of the aliasing, especially for cores with odd audio output frequencies while maintaining broad compatibility with TV's and audio gear.

## Developers, Developers, Developers, Developers

The open source nature of the MiSTer project necessarily entails more developer engagement than any private company making FPGA cores hiring individual developers could hope to achieve. The powerful framework and system files maintained by Alexey Melnikov (also known as Sorgelig) makes it easier for core developers to focus on developing the logic of their core as opposed to focusing too much time on how to support controllers, video output, audio output, and all the other struggles that previous FPGA developers had to deal with.

The users of the MiSTer get to enjoy the benefits of this developer-friendly framework in the form of frequent core updates and a large number of exciting features that are available to all cores.
